## How to use online searches and resources effectively

Keep the following tips in mind:

1. Don't start by going to your favourite search engine! Start by writing down,
   perhaps as a comment in your code, what exactly you are looking for.

   When we first learn how to code, it takes a lot of our brain power to
   understand other people's code. It's easy therefore to get lost in code we
   find online, and to forget what we were looking for in the first place.

   If we keep a record of what exactly we are looking for, we can refer to it if
   we get lost, confused, or stuck.

2. Phrase your search query in the form of a question, for example:

    > how do you get command line arguments in node js

    Make sure to include "node js" in your query if we're working in Node, or
    "javascript" if we're working in the browser. Answers in other programming
    languages aren't the most useful :)

3. Stack Overflow is your friend.

    Your search results will usually include links to Stack Overflow, official
    documentation, and blogs/tutorials. Official documentation is dense and
    written for more experienced programmers, so for the time being, you'll have
    more luck with Stack Overflow.

4. Skip to the highest rated answer, or the one with the green checkmark (marked
   as the approved answer).

    Learning how to ask the right questions about programming is part of
    learning programming. This means that many questions asked by beginners
    might confuse us, because they're still learning how to ask the right
    questions. The top or approved answers are usually more clear and are
    therefore a better place to start on a Stack Overflow page.

5. Don't get stuck for too long â€“ ask a mentor for help or to search with you.

    You can learn a lot by watching how a more experienced developer makes sense
    of Stack Overflow or other resources.
