## One of the most important core skills is defining algorithms

Here's a more formal definition by Anany Levitin:

> An _algorithm_ is a sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a
> problem, i.e., for obtaining a required output for any legitimate input in a
> finite amount of time.


__Unambiguous:__ There should be no doubts about what each instruction means.
This often requires that we break down all actions into very small and concrete
steps.


__Problem/required output:__ What, specifically, concretely, are we trying to
accomplish? What problems are we trying to solve, and how do we define such that
a computer can solve it?  What does correct output look like?

This is often one of the hardest parts of programming â€“ defining what exactly
we're trying to get computers to do. That is, finding ways to interpret
real-world situations so that we can make useful computations related to them.


__Legitimate input:__ What kind of data is required to reach the required
output? Where does this data come from, and how is it made computable?


__Finite amount of time:__ The algorithm has to produce the desired output
before the end of the universe.









### Recipes are a form of day-to-day algorithm

We're going to watch a short video about following recipes for making peanut
butter sandwiches.

As we watch the video, think about the following:

1. What are legitimate inputs to the recipes?

2. What are legitimate outputs, that is, how do we know that the result of
   following the recipe is 'correct'?

3. Why did the recipes in the video produce incorrect outputs?
