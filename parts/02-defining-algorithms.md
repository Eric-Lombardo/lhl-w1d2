## One of the most important core skills is defining algorithms

Here's a more formal definition by Anany Levitin:

> An _algorithm_ is a sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a
> problem, i.e., for obtaining a required output for any legitimate input in a
> finite amount of time.




__Unambiguous:__ There should be no doubts about what each instruction means.
This often requires that we break down all actions into very small and concrete
steps.

__Problem/required output:__ This is often one of the hardest parts of
programming â€“ understanding exactly what we're trying to get the computer to do.

__Legitimate input:__ You can't make a PB&J sandwich if all you've got is bread,
peanut butter, and batteries. The ingredients you start with matter.

__Finite amount of time:__ The algorithm has to produce the desired output
before the end of the universe.
