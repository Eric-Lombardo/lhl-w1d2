2. What makes google docs useful?

- can access it from anywhere
    - any device
    - anywhere in the world with an internet connection, probably a relatively
      fast one
    - any platform
    - can even use it offline, but don't have access to online features
        (like on chromebooks)
- multiple people can work on a document at once
- distributed the computational work, stored on google's servers 
- free
- saves data to 'the cloud'
- can work on multiple projects, has organization features (folders, stars, etc)
- the code can be updated without the user having to download or install
  anything

3. What concerns do you have about using google docs, or if you don't use
   it, why not?

- less features than other office programs
- being on the web can be a limitation
- forced to have an account to use it fully
    - encourage an account
- what is google really doing with the data?
- works with some specific data formats and not others (ex: pdf)
    - was a problem before, now it's more robust
- because it's online (ish), it could go down and you won't have access
- you may lose your data
- must have internet (or a chromebook)
- your files are vulnerable to hackers

4. What is google docs made of? What is required to make google doc useful?

- databases
- software running on servers
- a client to access google docs (laptop, phone, etc)
- javascript, css, html, probably lots of other languages, frameworks, etc
- fast servers, load balancing, distributing traffic, efficient code/hardware
    - infrastructure
    - maintenance (hardware, people, code, debugging)
    - electricity
    - water
    - giant warehouses
- user interface
- users (and their data)

5. Given our answers to questions 2-4, how might we define 'web app'?

- a web service that allows user authentication, is personalized
- an app that runs on web technologies
- serves a purpose
    - for its end users, they'll get something out of it
    - for enough people to have a large enough user base
- portable (on your phone, you can take it with you)
    - multi-platform
