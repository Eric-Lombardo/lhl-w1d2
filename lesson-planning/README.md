# W1D2 - A Developer's Workflow

In this lesson, we're going to discuss what web development is from both
technical and social perspectives, touching on what web apps are, who web
developers are, what web developers are responsible for in their work, and what
purposes they build web apps for. Focusing then on the technical details of web
development, we're going to learn about algorithms – what they are and how to
come up with our own. We're going to solidify this learning by following along
with how one developer (the instructor) defines and implements an algorithm that
solves a simple computational problem.

## Learning goals

### For students

1. Define: web app, web development, web developer, algorithm, input, output,
   legitimate input, legimitate output.
2. Identify at least two key people that contributed to our current
   understanding of what algorithms are.
3. Explain why algorithms need to be unambiguous, why they need to have clearly
   defined inputs and outputs, and why they should compute legitimate outputs
   from legitimate inputs in a finite amount of time.
4. List and describe the steps to solving a simple problem computationally, that
   is, breaking the problem down, identifying inputs and outputs, generating
   test data, writing notes and comments, etc.
5. List and describe strategies for making the most of online searches when
   working out coding problems.

### For Horațiu

1. Learn the names of all the students.
2. Learn about why students want to learn programming and web development.

## Prerequisites

1. Students can implement JavaScript code involving variables, arrays, simple
   loops, and simple conditional statements.
2. Students can execute JavaScript code using a command line terminal.
