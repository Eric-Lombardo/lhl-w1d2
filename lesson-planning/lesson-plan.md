# Lesson design notes

- from http://teachtogether.tech/#s:checklists-design

## What's the big idea?

1. What problems will people learn how to solve?

2. What concepts and techniques will people learn?

    - students will learn problem-solving and debugging techniques for novice
      programmers, while being introduced to some general problem-solving
      techniques that are helpful for other levels of experience:

      - breaking a problem down into smaller parts
      - keeping notes/pseudo-code to reduce the cognitive load inherent to
        learning how to define algorithms, and implementing them in JS
      - testing as you go, and testing every time you make a change
      - using error messages to hone in on bugs/mistakes
      - approaching incorrect code systematically to find bugs/mistakes

3. What technologies, packages, or functions will people use?

4. What terms or jargon will you define?

    - algorithm

5. What analogies will you use to explain concepts?

    - an algorithm is a like a recipe, only computers can't make inferences or
      think so, these kinds of recipes need to detailed and specific enough for
      computers to follow the steps

6. What mistakes or misconceptions do you expect?

7. What datasets will you use?

## What will learners do along the way?

- get to know a little bit about me and about each other

- help me understand why they're taking the bootcamp so as to best tailor my
  teaching to them (and so i can best understand how to break the spell)

### During the lesson

- start with an activity for introducing ourselves
    
    - talk about the 8 different reasons for learning programming

    - i go first: i introduce myself, i give a little background of my time as a
      coder and now as a teacher, then talk about how when i started learning
      how to code, what i most wanted was to learn how to use computers better,
      and to learn how to solve problems; today, what i am most trying to learn
      to do with code is to understand our world and to be able to ask questions
      about the influence of computing on our lives

    - students share their name, a little bit about themselves if they wish, and
      then their most important 2 or 3 reasons for learning how to code

- then, together, define web development

    - questions to draw out a short discussion:

    1. What are some examples of web apps you use in your day-to-day life?

        - facebook, twitter
        - youtube
        - wordpress
        - online banking

    2. What makes <youtube> useful?

    3. What concerns do you have about using <youtube>, or if you don't use
       it, why not?

    4. What is <youtube> made of? What is required to make <youtube> useful?

    5. Given our answers to questions 2-4, how might we define 'web app'?

    6. Given our answer to question 5, how might we define 'web development'?

    OLD QUESTIONS:

        comes to mind when you hear the words "web app"?

        1. Who is a web developer?
        2. What do web developers do?
        3. Where do web developers work?
        4. Why do web developers do what they do? Who pays them?
        5. Who's impacted by the work of web developers? How?
        6. What does someone need to know and be able to do in order to be a web
           developer?
        7. What do students need in order to learn web development? What do web
           developers need in order to be successful at the work?

        - come up with more Qs and polish them into 3 - 5, that draw out the
          interdisciplinarity of web development, how one needs to know how to
          program but how that's not enough, how the information systems being built
          are socio-technical, how they impact society

- from that discussion, jump into how what we're going to learn at LHL is
  primarily one aspect of all of that: how to build web applications with HTML,
  CSS and JS

    - a fundamental technical skill involved in that is learning how to solve
      problems using computation – what you might also call learning to code, or
      learning to program

    - today we're going to learn some techniques for doing that, but try to
      remember throughout your time here that this will only ever be one piece
      of the puzzle, albeit a difficult and important one to learn

    - don't know how to incorporate: that education is not neutral

- explain how one of the most important core skills they are here to learn is
  defining algorithms

- show BBC video, telling them that i will ask them the following questions
  after:

- would be nice to have them respond a bit to the video

    - what is an algorithm?
    - what ideas, knowledge, is computing related to? (math, algebra, military,
      engineering?)
    - maybe have a question that draws out the idea of breaking problems down
      into smaller ones, and the idea of the sequence of steps

- show the formal definition of an algorithm, then watch the PB&J video

- go over each of the four key parts of the definition

- break

- live code a simple problem together that is similar to ones they've seen, but
  not identical (so find a different problem than the sum one they did the day
  before, or, explain how this is something they've already solved?)

    - would be cool if i asked them to work in groups of 2-3 to define an
      algorithm for solving this problem, keeping in mind our discussion of what
      algorithms are

    - this problem is different enough
    - but, think of one that will hopefully relate to our discussion of who web
      developers are and what they do, and that requires a discussion of some
      decision being made

        - uses an accumulator variable to compute a single value
        - maybe also uses command line arguments; ideally, something else that
          will require us to do a simple web search

- if there's time, go over curriculum slides

## How are concepts connected?

1. Introductions (who we are and why we want to learn programming)

2. What is web development?

    - this will lead to a discussion of many aspects

    - at the end we'll summarize how from a technical perspective, it's about
      building web applications using HTML, CSS and JS

3. Defining and implementing algorithms as a core technical skill

4. Live coding a simple problem, step-by-step, highlighting manual tracing and
   debugging
